**Halve** is an extended SDK for the latest version of the GoldSrc Engine, built on the Half-Life 1 SDK by  Valve Corporation. The main purpose of the project is to improve and reorganize the current version of the Half-Life 1 SDK and add new features for the development of new mods.

## Warning

**By default, Halve uses a hook to intercept and manipulate dynamic library functions during execution. This may cause issues with Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC). Use at your own risk or turn off the hook!**
